# **Board?** *(pre-alpha)*
wip rust game
### Install guide
1. Install rust
2. Compile the game files

### Disclaimer: 
If you are testing the game on Windows then it might compile differently or take longer, I'm testing the game on Linux so I have no clue. Follow the compile options for rust on windows and the game should run the same.

### Compile Options (please read before use):
It can take up to 10 minutes to compile for the first time, I have compile options to make all compiles APART FROM the first way better, after the wait compiling will be very quick.
If you want it to be faster the first time:
1. Run **cargo clean**
2. Rename UNO.toml to Cargo.toml.
Regardless don't expect the first compile to be fast, you are compiling a game engine from scratch.
