# Board? (pre-alpha)
wip rust game


  
# Install guide
1. Install rust
2. Compile the game files

Disclaimer: If you are testing the game on Windows then it might compile differently or take longer, I'm testing the game on Void Linux so I have no clue. Follow the compile options for rust on windows and the game should run the same.
